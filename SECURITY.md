# Security Policy

If you believe you've identified a security vulnerability in Mastodon (a bug that allows something to happen that shouldn't be possible), send an email to <security@joinmastodon.org>.

You should *not* report such issues on GitHub or in other public spaces to avoid exposing Mastodon's users to increased risk.

## Scope
